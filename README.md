# PONG
This is the game Pong. It's my first project that I've made on my own without a tutorial. I'm using it to learn Python and Pygame. Stuff I still need to figure out--the display of the score doesn't update at the end of the game. It should be 5, not 4. More importantly, the movement of the ball as it bounces off the player paddles needs more complexity. Right now, it just bounces off with a velocity of 5. I would like to code it so that the angle is different depending on where on the paddle it bounces. Finally, the most important thing is that this code is probably not that organized or easily readable by anyone other than me. It seems like that's pretty normal for a beginner. Anyway, I'm aware of it. I'll keep working on my style.
